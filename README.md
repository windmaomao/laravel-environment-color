# Environment Color for Laravel 4

Adds an environment indicator color bar to either top or bottom of all pages to indicate 
if you are working in 'local' or 'production' environment. 
 
Use config.php to change position, and colors for default or 'local' environment. 

The color bar is set to be enabled when debug mode is off by default.
